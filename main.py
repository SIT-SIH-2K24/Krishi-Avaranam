    st.markdown(""" #### About the Project
                This project harnesses the power of machine learning to revolutionize plant disease detection through image analysis. By employing TensorFlow for precise model predictions and Google Generative AI for interactive chatbot support, our system is crafted to aid farmers and researchers in diagnosing plant health with unparalleled efficiency.

Dataset :
We use an enhanced dataset derived from an original collection, comprising approximately 87,000 RGB images of both healthy and diseased crop leaves. These images are meticulously categorized into 38 distinct classes, representing a wide array of crops and disease types.

Dataset Breakdown:

Training Set: 70,295 images for model training.
Testing Set: 33 images for evaluating model performance.
Validation Set: 17,572 images to fine-tune and validate model accuracy.
Key Features
State-of-the-Art ML Models: Our system employs advanced machine learning algorithms to achieve high precision in detecting plant diseases.
Instant Chat Support: With Google Generative AI integration, users receive real-time assistance, answering queries and providing support related to plant health.

Achievements : 
Optimized Performance: Significant enhancements in model accuracy and performance through architectural fine-tuning.
Enhanced User Experience: A user-friendly interface designed to facilitate seamless interaction with the system, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.

Future Goals : 

Dataset Expansion: Broaden the dataset to include a wider variety of plant species and disease types, enhancing the model's versatility.
Real-Time Feedback: Implement real-time data processing capabilities to deliver immediate analysis results upon image upload.
Chatbot Enhancement: Further develop the chatbot to provide more tailored advice and personalized support for users, enriching the overall user experience.
